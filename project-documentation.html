                                The types of materials that can be collected during documentation include written text, images (photos, videos, drawings), and sound or video recordings. These materials are selected based on what needs to be recorded and the purpose of the documentation.</p>

                                <p><h4>What is the purpose of documentation?</h4>
                                The main purpose of documentation is to collect information, create high-quality materials, enable the recovery of knowledge, and generate resources on the information collected. This means that documentation is not just about collecting data, but also about ensuring that the materials collected can be used to generate value and insights in the future.</p>
                            <p><h4>What media/device do we use to document?</h4>
                                <p>When deciding what to collect during documentation, there are several factors to consider, including convenience, portability, and relevance to the subject matter. 
                                </br>For example, written text may be more convenient to collect than images or videos, but images and videos may be more relevant to certain types of information. Portability is also an important consideration, as materials that are easy to transport and store can be more accessible and useful in the long term.</p>                              
                                <center><img src="https://truscribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/02_Video-Vs-Written-Content.jpg" style="width:300px;display:block"></center> 
                                <p>Finally, it is important to consider the pros and cons of each type of media when selecting materials for documentation. For instance, written text can be more detailed and precise, but images and videos may be more effective at conveying information quickly and clearly. By carefully selecting materials and considering the advantages and disadvantages of each, documentation techniques can be optimized to create a valuable resource for future use.</p>

                                    In terms of best methods for creating multimedia content, it is important to prioritize ease of use and accessibility. Users should be able to easily learn and use the tools necessary to create multimedia content. 
                                    </br>Additionally, the content should be easily accessible and updateable to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date.</p>
                                    <p>To store all of the different types of media used in multimedia content creation, it is important to choose tools and methods that can handle multiple forms of media. This includes storage options that can accommodate text, images, video, and audio in a single location.</p>

                                    <td>
                                     <p>The best solution for creating shareable and accessible content is to use pure text. This eliminates the need for special software or editors and ensures that the content can be read across platforms. To publish the content on the World Wide Web (WWW), it is recommended to use HTML to define the content, CSS to define the layout, and Markdown for simple content creation. These methods are easy to learn and use, and the resulting content can be stored and shared in achievable locations such as GitHub or GitLab sites.</p>

                                    <p><h4>Why not Microsoft Word/ WordPad/ LibreOffice?</h4>
                                        When it comes to creating content for the web, pure text editors are often the best choice. While Microsoft Word, WordPad, and LibreOffice are popular word processors, they create files with binary or inserted code that can make it difficult to read the content across different platforms.</p>
                                    <p><h4>Recommended Text Editors</h4>
                                        <p>Instead, it is recommended to use a pure text editor when creating content for the web. Some popular text editors include Notepad++, Github Atom, Sublime Text 3, and Visual Studio Code. These text editors offer a number of advantages over other options.
                                         <center><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b66a6225ced58e73da52a4e79afe47f2/fa6bbdf2cc49d75f-d1/s540x810/dbb973f1f39b070c03ac7ef6b89f10afabba5d7f.pnj" style="width:500px;display:block"></center> 
                                    <p><h4>Advantages over other text editors</h4>
                                         <p>One of the main advantages of pure text editors is that they allow for unlimited text length. This makes it easier to write longer pieces of content without worrying about hitting character or file size limits. Additionally, many text editors offer syntax highlighting, enhancements, scripts, and snippets to make writing and editing content more efficient.
                                            <center><p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hti3RQ9LNeBrnEfvtD3xH7-1200-80.jpg" style="width:400px;display:block"></p></center>
                                            <p>Pure text editors are also often open source and free, making them an accessible choice for a wide range of users. They are also cross-platform, meaning they can be used on different operating systems without issues. By using a pure text editor, users can create high-quality, easy-to-read content that can be easily shared and accessed across different platforms.</p>

                                        <td>
                                         <p><h4>1. Practise</h4>
                                            First and foremost, it's important to practice regularly. The more you write, the more comfortable you'll become with the process, and the better your documentation will be overall.</p>
                                        <p><h4>2. Document as you work</h4>
                                            One of the most effective ways to write documentation is to document as you work. This means that you should be writing documentation as you develop your project or work on a particular task. By doing so, you'll be able to capture the information while it's still fresh in your mind, and you'll be less likely to forget important details later on.</p>
                                        <p><h4>3. Write step-by-step as you develop</h4>
                                            <p>Another key aspect of writing effective documentation is to write step-by-step instructions. This means breaking down tasks into small, manageable steps, and providing clear and concise instructions for each one. By doing so, you'll make it easier for users to follow along and complete the task at hand.</p>
